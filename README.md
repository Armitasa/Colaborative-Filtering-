This recommendation system is build using a Steam Games dataset. The dataset includes user id, games and hours played. I Used hours plays as a base for a rating scale.After cleaning the dataframe I created the user-item matrix and the item-item matrix.
Fitst I build 3 recommender models with the turicreate library; based on popularity, cosine similarity and pearson correlation. cosine model yeilded better results amongst all three.
In the next section  I built a system from grounds up using the user-item matrix and the item-item matrix.The main function uses the cosine similarity as a basis. Item-item matrix can take a game and recommend 10 similar games.user-item matrix calculates a similarity score based on the games a user has ranked highly and can recommend 10 games for a particular user based on the score.
